## Question 1

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io//ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
hist(choco$Rating)
```

The ratings seem to be distributed with an average around 3-3.5, there are no outliers.

## Question 2

```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
```

There is no correlation between cocoa percentage and the rating of the chocolate bar.
